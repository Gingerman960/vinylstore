# Vinyl Store

This is Web vinyl store prototype written without web frameworks

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Gingerman960/vinylstore.git

# Change directory to your project folder
cd vinylstore

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Usage
Unfortunately, because of parcel using ES modules there is no possibility for just opening index.html directly from the browser.

So in order to run the app you will need either to deploy build to the remote server, or use parcel's built in dev server

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run start

# Make the build
npm run build
```
